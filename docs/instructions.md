## AI Instructions – Echoes in Orbit

### Purpose
This file defines constraints and decision rules for AI assistance during development. AI is not user-facing.

---

### Global Rules
- Do not introduce features not explicitly approved
- Prefer fewer elements over clever abstractions
- Silence and restraint take priority over visual flair

---

### Design Decision Prompt
"Does this change preserve the Stellarium-style exploration metaphor?"

---

### UX Decision Prompt
"Can a new user understand this without instructions in under 10 seconds?"

---

### Performance Prompt
"Will this change reduce FPS or increase bundle size noticeably? If yes, reject."

---

### Validation Checklist (Mandatory)
- Anonymous only
- Delivery date required
- No message categories
- No lighting or glow effects
- Star brightness tied only to like count
- Locked stars unreadable

---

### Final Enforcement Rule
If a change adds noise, labels, or explanation into space, it violates the product vision and must be rejected.
